    Surely, right? It seems that almost everyone says this. And that almost everyone reccomends it
    as being a supposedly <span class="quote">user friendly</span> way to use Arch.
    Well...

    <p>
      This is probably what you should care about most. Manjaro has a track record of
      <em>really</em> poor security.
    </p>

    <h2>SSL Certs</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://redd.it/4inrut/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
        Manjaro has let their SSL certificate expire (twice!).
      </a>
      Want to see what incredible <span class="quote">advice</span> they gave?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Seems we forgot to update our SSL certificate in time. [...]
      <br>
      In time, please use followed workaround:
      <br>
      <br>
      open a terminal
      <br>
      enter followed line: sudo date -s 2015-04-06 +09
      <br>
      This will set back your system time to Mo 6. Apr 00:00:03 CEST 2015.

    <p>This doesn't really need any further explanation.</p>
    <p>
      Holding packages also causes security issues, but that is better addressed in the Stability
      section.</p>

    <summary>Stability</summary>
    <p>
      I have used both Manjaro and Arch, and have had almsost no issues on Arch. Manjaro required
      constant coaxing. Isn't that what Manjaro is trying to <span class="quote">solve</span>?
    </p>
    <h2>Holding packages for two weeks</h2>
    <p>
      You've probably seen across their resources that Manjaro holds Arch packages behind for two
      weeks. Stability is touted as the main reason for this, but this doesn't really add up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, what this actually means is that software upgrades reach you later for seemingly
      no reason. That's getting bug fixes, security patches, new features two whole weeks late.
      Aside from the obvious downside this brings, it also causes a more insidious issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm sure one of the reasons you're gravitating towards Manjaro is the AUR. Being able to
      run install scripts for anything sure sounds neat, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, most of these scripts are written with the assumption that you aren't running a system
      that's effectively two weeks out of date. This causes
      <a class="cursor-help" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported"
        rel="noopener" target="_blank">partial upgrades</a>, which are unsupported. At best, that
      program won't install properly, and at worst it can wreak havoc across your entire system
      with no obvious way to fix it.
    </p>

    <summary>Management</summary>
    <h2>Funding</h2>
    <p>
      More recently, Manjaro had a controversy with their treasurer. A team member had purchased a
      gaming laptop, and the treasurer asked to clarify this purchase.
      <a href="https://redd.it/hxp3zi">This ultimately resulted in the treasurer being removed.</a>
      The project <em>treasurer</em> was removed for asking someone to justify an expense filed
      under the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cool and normal, right?
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>DDoSing the AUR (yes, seriously)</summary>
    <h2>Pamac sends thousands of requests</h2>
    <p>
      Manjaro's AUR helper, pamac, shipped a version with a bug that accidentally sent thousands
      of requests to the AUR per user. This rendered the AUR offline for <em>all</em> users across
      every Arch-based distro for a few hours.

      While this absolutely was not intentional, this highlights their poor QA testing.
