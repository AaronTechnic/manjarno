    <h2>SSL Certs</h2>

        Manjaro has let their SSL certificate expire (twice!).

      Want to see what incredible <span class="quote">advice</span> they gave?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Seems we forgot to update our SSL certificate in time. [...]
      <br>
      In time, please use followed workaround:
      <br>
      <br>
      open a terminal
      <br>
      enter followed line: sudo date -s 2015-04-06 +09
      <br>
      This will set back your system time to Mo 6. Apr 00:00:03 CEST 2015.
